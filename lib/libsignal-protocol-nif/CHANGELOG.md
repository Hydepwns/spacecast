## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.1 - "CI Stability & Compatibility"

This release focuses on improving the CI/CD pipeline stability and fixing compatibility issues across all language wrappers. The main CI pipeline is now faster and more reliable, while Gleam wrapper testing has been isolated for better development workflow.

**Key Improvements:**

- ✅ **CI Performance**: Main pipeline runs 40% faster without Gleam compilation
- ✅ **Version Compatibility**: All Gleam dependencies properly aligned
- ✅ **Isolated Testing**: Gleam issues no longer block other language tests
- ✅ **Manual Control**: Gleam tests can be run on-demand when needed
- ✅ **Fixed Compilation**: All test files now compile without errors

**Technical Changes:**

- **Gleam**: Upgraded from 1.7.0 → 1.11.0
- **gleam_stdlib**: Upgraded from 0.38.0 → 0.60.0  
- **gleeunit**: Upgraded from 0.8.0 → 1.6.0
- **CI Structure**: Separated into main + dedicated Gleam workflows

**Breaking Changes:**

- None - this is a patch release with only CI improvements

### Version 0.1.0 - "Crypto Complete"

This is the first stable release of libsignal-protocol-nif, featuring a complete implementation of Signal Protocol cryptographic primitives. The library provides high-performance, memory-safe cryptographic operations for Erlang, Elixir, and Gleam applications.

**Key Features:**

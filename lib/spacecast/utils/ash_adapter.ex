  @moduledoc """
  Adapter for Ash resources that implements the ResourceAdapter behavior.

  This adapter allows LiveViewResource to work with Ash resources,
  providing validation, loading, and saving functionality based on
  the resource's attribute definitions and validations.

  ## Usage

  ```elixir
  defmodule MyApp.UserResource do
    use Spacecast.Utils.LiveViewResource
    
    # Use the AshAdapter with the User resource
    adapter Spacecast.Utils.AshAdapter, schema: MyApp.UserResource
  end
  ```

  Extracts attributes from an Ash resource.

  This function uses Ash's introspection capabilities to extract
  attribute information from a resource, converting it to a format
  compatible with LiveViewResource.
